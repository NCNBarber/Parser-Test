# Parser-Test

Contained within the mygrammar.pegjs and test.js files are my initial work and research into parsing expression grammar with PEG.js, a parser generator for JavaScript. After learning more about parsing expression grammar, I moved onto working on 'ProseMaker' directly with the supervision of Daniel Baird. (November 2016)
